This is the 7th project of the GeeksHubs Academy Fullstack Developer Bootcamp, showcasing real-world frontend development skills with REACT and REDUX.
The project consists of developing the frontend corresponding to a social networking application.
Users will be able to register to the application, log in and access their personal area. In addition, users will be able to access the general Time-line, follow/unfollow users, publish new posts, leave comments, search for users.....

There is also an administration view where you can have an overall control of the application.
